title: My First Experience being a Dungeon Master
---

<div>So recently a few of my friends decided that we wanted to get into Dungeons and Dragons. This was mostly due to enjoying <a href="http://www.worldofmunchkin.com/game/">Munchkin</a> a lot.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>I started doing some research on the best way to get into D&amp;D. First I needed to pick an edition. 3.5e seems to be a clear favourite in the past, but I had heard that 5e was simpler than any previous version. Finally I found a glowing review of the <a href="http://io9.com/the-d-d-starter-set-is-a-great-way-to-introduce-newbies-1602583516">DnD Starter Kit</a> </div>
<div><br></div>

<div><br></div>
<div>Turns out to have been a great choice. The kit includes a full set of dice, 5 pre-made characters, a rule book and campaign book and it was like 20$.</div>

<div>I'm really glad the characters were pre-made. The rules are complicated enough for a first time group without having to deal with making a characters.<b><br></b>
</div>

<div>The campaign book was very helpful to me as a DM. I was really worried I would be able to improvise fast enough or well enough to keep the game flowing, but that turned out to be a bit of an over reaction.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Knowing all the rules is hard! I had to constantly check to see what actions a player could take, how ranged combat works and what kind of bonuses people would get.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>All in all though, I had a really fun time and I think the rest of the party did too!</div>
