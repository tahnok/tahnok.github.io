This fall I finally got my Amateur Radio license, which has led me down a deeeeep technical rabbit hole.
I want to try and write more so I'm going to be dumping a lot my researching into blog posts.

Tonight's reseach: *Bazooka Antennas*

Specifically I am looking at "double bazooka" antenna.
From what I can tell these are mostly used as HF antennas (10m to 160m).
The only thing you need to construct them seems to be coaxial cable and twin lead.

Basically you cut a piece of coax to "length" for your desired frequency.
In the center you strip away just the outer layer of plastic and cut the outer braid in half.
Connect the feedline's center/outer to each half.
Do something funky at the ends of the antennas (??)
