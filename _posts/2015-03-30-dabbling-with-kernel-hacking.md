So I have this fascination with understanding how things work and it has had the unfourunate of becoming interested in **THE LINUX KERNEL**

I've seen some cool (and excited) posts from [Julia](http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/09/18/you-can-be-a-kernel-hacker/) [Evans](http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/08/day-6-i-wrote-a-rootkit/) [about](http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/07/day-5-i-wrote-a-kernel-module/) [the](http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/01/04/4-paths-to-being-a-kernel-hacker/) [topic](I ran out of links)! It got me excited, but more importantly it made the topic seems significantly less scary and approachable. I've been trying to learn C for a while now because so much important computer code is written in it.

To that end, one of the blog posts linked above mentioned the [EUDYPTULA CHALLENGE](http://eudyptula-challenge.org/) which sounds exciting! (side note: [eudpytpula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudyptula) is a GENUS of penguins) The gist of the challenge is that you are presented with a series of tasks that teach you more and more about kernels.

I've completed task 1! I would share the code with you but I've taken a VOW OF SILENCE so that each new recruit can work through the tasks on their own. Instead I will share some of the useful kernel resources I've found so far.

 - [The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/2.6/html/): Pretty good guide to kernel modules, although it is for a much older kernel. Maybe that will be an issue at one point?
 - [Linux Cross Reference](http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/) pretty useful so far

The biggest challenge I've faced so far has been getting Thunderbird to send email in a format that's comprehensible to the little script that is is the Eudpyptula. Turns out email is a crufty old protocol.

Soon, I shall be MASTER OF THE LINUX KERNEL (I hope)
