When minecraft first came out, I thought I wouldn’t enjoy playing the game because I generally didn’t enjoy open ended games. I had tried playing World of Warcraft before, but the sheer number of options open to a new player put me off. When I was playing a video game, I wanted there to be a plot, with a goal or a story or something!</p>
<p>My attidude has shifted. Now I really enjoy the lack of structure in minecraft. The fact that it’s almost entirely open ended is pretty fun because I get to decide how to play whenever I play. Do I want to build something? Do I want to mine? Do I want to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sNge0Ywz-M">construct a cpu inside of my game so I can program in my program</a>? <br>
But how do you make a game where you can do anything fun? With self imposted limit. I choose to play in survival mode rather than in creative mode. Why would I choose to make something harder? It’s because certain kinds of fun come from doing something hard. I think an integral part of play is the challenge.<br>
Minecraft illuminates how in all games, we impose limits on our selves. There’s a greater sense of accomplishment that comes from creating something where you had to forage all the materials your self. It's harder but it's more fun.<br>
My problem initially with minecraft was that making up your own story is hard but because it's hard it's more fun. It forces me to be more active and creative. And I like that</p>
