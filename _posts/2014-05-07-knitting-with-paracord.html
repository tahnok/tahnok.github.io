title: Knitting with Paracord!
---

<p>My girlfriend recently finished sewing a bag for me, but it doesn’t have a strap yet!<br>
At first I tried making <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080214132055/http://www.slatts.fsworld.co.uk/slatts-knot.htm">Slatts Rescue Belt</a> by following this instructable on <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-a-Paracord-Rescue-Belt/?ALLSTEPS">how to make a paracord rescue belt</a>, but I didn’t turn out the way I was hoping at all…<br>
Instead I figured I would try knitting the strap. I’ve never tried knitting paracord before, but the strap that I end up with would just as well as the other method since I end up with a flat strap that I can unravel quickly.<br>
If you want to learn how to knit check out this video:<br>

<p>or this book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Knit-Step-Vikki-Haffenden/dp/0756692717/">Knit: Step by Step</a> It has lots of patterns and is pretty good if you like learning from books.<br>
The pattern I’m using is one row knit, one row purl and it’s 6 rows wide.</p>
