So tomorrow (I guess later today technically) is [makerfaire](http://makerfaireottawa.com/)! Yay!

I wanted to share some of the links to stuff for my project for people interested in learning more.

# Rule 110

The [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110) on Rule110 is _really_ good if you want to learn more

# The Dress

First off, here is the code running on the dress: <https://github.com/tahnok/rule110_dress>

And here's the install link for the app to control the dress: <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.tahnok.bluefruit.le.connect>

![](../images/rule110_control_qr.png)

The source code for that app is over here: <https://github.com/tahnok/Bluefruit_LE_Connect_Android>

# The Hat

Code for the hat is here: <https://github.com/tahnok/BlueBrim>, and my build notes / guide is [the post before this one](http://blog.tahnok.me/post/bluebrim-rgb-lights-on-a-hat-with-bonus-bluetooth.html)

# The Weird Interactive Piece Thing

I also have a [post about last year](http://blog.tahnok.me/post/makerfaire-ottawa-rule-110.html). Source code is not in git (sorry)
