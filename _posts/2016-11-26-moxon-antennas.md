In my search for easy to build antennas I can use in the VHF/UHF frequency range I have stumbled across [the moxon antenna](http://www.moxonantennaproject.com/).

The antenna was mentioned in passing in Groundwave, the [OARC's newsletter](http://www.oarc.net/newsletter/).
It looks like the antenna can be constructed with 2 pieces of wire cut to appropriate lengths for your wave length.
The wires are laid out in a rectangle with a small gap between them.
Only one of the antennas is "active", which is to say only one wire has feedline attached to it.
The other wire is "parasitic", meaning that it's important for magical RF reasons (waves hands mysteriously).
It's also a directional antenna, which means that it has better reception when it's "pointed" at the source

If I can find a good souce of solid copper wires, then I'm definetly going to consider making this antenna.
