Last week I was lucky enough to attend DEF CON for the first time and it did not disappoint. I've been out of commission for a few days with the con plague, but I'm feeling well enough now to try some blogging.</p>
<p>This isn't the first write up to appear for the badge challenge. There's the <a href="http://elegin.com/dc22/">winning team's write up</a>, and runner up <a href="http://potatohatsecurity.tumblr.com/post/94565729529/defcon-22-badge-challenge-walkthrough">team potatoe sec's</a> write up.</p>
<p>Why am I writing another one? Mostly it's because I wanted to make sure I really understood the challenge and it's solution. Additionally, I've noticed that the other two are either missing steps, or contain mistakes.</p>
<p>Let's start with some background (you can skip this if you know about the badge challenge). DEFCON is a hacker conference, and hackers love puzzles. As a result, for the past 5 years (I think) <a href="https://twitter.com/1o57">1o57</a> has created a series of mind bending puzzles centered around the badges that DEFCON attendees get. It's designed to be solved in 3 days and force people to interact and talk since there are multiple different types of badges.</p>
<p>My interest in the badge challenge first got piqued when I read through a DC21 walkthrough by <a href="http://elegin.com/dc21/">last year's winning team</a>. I didn't have a team or the willingness to miss all the other things going at DEFCON, so most of this walk through is based off of the two guides I mentioned above and a taxi ride with a member of the runner up team on the way to the airport, and the fine folks who hung around room 1057.</p>
<p>So, what follows is as legible and clear a walkthrough as I can manage. Please leave comments if you spot any mistakes, or feel I've explained something using an identity like 2+2=5.</p>
<p>If you want to follow along at home, you can download <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9393938/dc22-badge.zip">this archive</a> which contains as much of the badge challenge materials as I could manage to gather together. I'm still missing good photos of the front and back of all the badges, so if you have a one, please send it my way.</p>

<h1>Lanyards</h1>

<p>This is the lanyard. There are 3 important parts to it.</p>
<p>First, there's the Chinese numbers on the left, which you can read with this handy chart:</p>
<p>一      1<br>
二      2<br>
三      3<br>
四      4<br>
五      5<br>
六      6<br>
七      7<br>
八      8<br>
九      9<br>
十      10</p>
<p>Then, here are the weird symbols in the middle. Those are 4 digit numbers written using the Cistercian cipher from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ciphers_of_the_Monks">The Ciphers of the Monks</a>. You can decode them with:</p>

<p>The last part is a Korean word, saying either vertical or horizontal</p>
<p>수직 (sujig): vertical</p>
<p>수평 (supyeong): horizontal</p>
<p>Big thanks to 1o57, who showed up at one point with a full set of EIGHT lanyards, pictured below</p>

<p>It was pretty tough trying to gather all of them. Initially, the total number of lanyards was unclear.</p>
<p>We had a hell of a time trying to gather all of the lanyards before 1o57, since we assumed the numerals were unique and didn't look for the other 4 and we thought there might be a lanyard with a Chinese 1 or 3. Also, we thought there might even be 9 lanyards, since there were 3 "suits" in the DEFCON iconography: (the happy skull and cross-bones, the rotary dial and the floppy disk).</p>
<p>Anyway, how do you decode these?? It turns out the Cistercian numbers are all in the range of upper case decimal ASCII, but without an ordering it's gibberish.</p>
<p>First, you have to divide the lanyards into vertical and horizontal.</p>
<p>At one point LoST mentioned that he really loved weaving potholders as a kid, so clearly the lanyards need to be woven together in some fashion.</p>
<p>Next, it turns out that all of the lanyards are less than 15, so they can be written in binary using only 4 bits.</p>
