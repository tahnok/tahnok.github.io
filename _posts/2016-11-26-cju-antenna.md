Ok, I know I just posted about Moxon antennas, but doing an image search for moxon antennas led me to the CJU antenna.

Apparently CJU stands for Canary Jail Umbrella because the author of the article who made it popular constructed it out of the tubing used in canary cages (or jails) and wire from a broken antenna.
It's designed for use talking to satellites which I am interested in, and it's very small and looks pretty easy to build.

I think it's a 2 element yagi optimized for 70cm/UHF, and it's also known as an [IOio](http://www.ea4cax.com/paginaea4cyq/Antenaioio/ioioingles.pdf)

It's constructed with a rectangle of wire, and a length of wire mounted to a small boom.
The rectangular element is driven, and the length of wire is the parasitic/reflector element.
