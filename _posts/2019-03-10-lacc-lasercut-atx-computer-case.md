I've been working on this project for over a year now, but I can finally share it comfortably. Presenting: **LACC** Lasercut ATX Computer case

This all came about because I needed a computer case (for a computer) and I went looking online to see if anyone had made one that could be cut on a laser cutter.
Much to my dissapointment, I couldn't find any!
So I said fine, I'll freaking build one.

You can download all the files [here](../images/LACC-20190310.zip) from this blog, but I've also uploaded the design to [github](http://github.com/tahnok/LACC) and [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3483130) for... marketing/posterity.

I hope it proves useful as a template for further customization.
Adding extra art work to be etched into the front/side/top with a laser should be _really_ easy to do.

This is a full sized ATX computer case you can laser cut (and probably cut using a CNC but I don't have one of those)

It should fit any ATX compliant motherboard, but I've only tried the one motherboard I have.

It has space for 3x 3.5" hard drives and a 2.5" hard drive, which are held by seperate 3d printed modules.

The entire design was done in Fusion 360. You can view it / download it [here](https://a360.co/2EToDJn)

## Next revision

So far it's working pretty well, but I have a few extra things that I need to change

 1. The tabs between the PCI-E cards are wayyyy to tiny. I need to make them bigger
 1. There is no power button... My mobo has one built in, but yours may not.
