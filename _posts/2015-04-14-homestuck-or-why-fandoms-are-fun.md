So recently I've been reading through a webcomic called Homestuck, which I totally recommend if and only if you have a lot of free time and enjoy silly computer jokes. Sadly it's a bit tricky to get into. Also it's stupendously long like ["251% the size of the Lord of the Rings"](http://readmspa.org/stats/)

TIPS ON GETTING STARTED:

 - Click on http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6
 - Ignore some of the weird bits like that the fact the website is called MS paint adventure. The author (andrew hussie) has a few other comics
 - keep going

Part of the fun is the jokes/puns, but also the crazily complicated plot. Like, it's sufficiently weird and wonky that I have to consult the [extensively curated fan wiki](http://mspaintadventures.wikia.com/wiki/Homestuck) on a fairly regular basis.
