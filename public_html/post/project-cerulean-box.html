  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I found a way to combine a bunch of things I have wanted to learn together into one project!</p>

<p>For a while, I have been fascinated with phone phreaking, and specifically the mythical BLUE BOX.
Lots of myths and history surounding it.
I think I can probably still play with it on <a href="http://www.projectmf.org/">Project MF</a>, but we will see.</p>

<p>It seems like a great way to learn more electronics stuff, and some radio adjacent stuff too.
I’ll need to figure out how to generate waves at specfic frequencies and how to combine them.</p>

<p>I happen to have bought an stm32 f3 discovery that seems like a good platform for this.
I think it’s fast enough to bit bang out a wave at 2600Hz?
Guess I will find out!</p>

<p>I also want to do this in rust.
The f3 also seems to have decent rust support.
See the <a href="https://docs.rs/f3/0.6.1/f3/">f3 crate</a> and <a href="https://japaric.github.io/discovery/">discovery</a></p>

<p>I wanted to write up some quick notes of things I learned getting <a href="https://github.com/tahnok/cerulean_box">cerulean box</a> blinking.</p>

<p>Step 1 was to create a new rust project and add the f3 dependency. After that, I copied the <a href="https://docs.rs/f3/0.6.1/f3/examples/_03_blinky/index.html">blinky.rs</a> to my project as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.rs</code></p>

<p>Next I had to add a few more dependencies, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cortex-m</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cortex-m-rt</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">panic-semihosting</code>.
This was enough to get rust complaining about an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eh_personality</code>.
No idea what that was, but I made it go away by copy the contents of the f3 project’s <a href="https://github.com/tahnok/cerulean_box/blob/de742b6a597fae6d8a96af6cb5bcddff1af15a99/.cargo/config">.cargo/config</a>.
As far as I can tell, this species the target architecture as being <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">thumbv7em-none-eabihf</code> which is ARM (thumbv7 specificall), with no OS and support for hard float.</p>

<p>That was enough to get things compiling, but then gdb would start…
In the f3 example, I was able to type continue but all gdb could do was disassemble main.
It turns out I also needed to copy <a href="https://github.com/tahnok/cerulean_box/blob/de742b6a597fae6d8a96af6cb5bcddff1af15a99/.gdbinit">.gdbinit</a>.
I believe this works because I have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">set auto-load safe-path /</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.gdbinit</code>.</p>

<p>After that, I get blinky leds!</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<p>There’s a few things I want to do next.
I need to actually twiddle a pin at a given frequency.
That means learning how timers work probably, maybe interupts if I want to be able to other things.</p>

<p>I also need to figure how this semihosting thing. I think that’s so I can run the code from my laptop, and get error messages, strack traces and breakpoints which seem useful, but… I don’t know how to turn it off.
How to I make a binary I can flash onto the f3 directly?</p>

<p>Adventures for next time!</p>
