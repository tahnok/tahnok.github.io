      <p><img src="../images/w600_f52670010fd9b28251a6d0334ff8cdce.jpg" style="height: auto;" alt="http://images.fotocommunity.de/bilder/bach-fluss-see/see-teich-tuempel/meditation-c20eccba-2002-4e13-a226-5f2d811abe9c.jpg"><br>
The first time I meditated I was in high school and it was the night before a big exam. I don’t remember well how I found out about it (probably stumbleupon) but it became an important part of the exam preperation ritual for me. I’d lie in bed before going to sleep and count to 100. I stopped doing it on my own for a long time, although I did some small meditation sessions during the martial arts classes I took in high school and university.</p>
<p>Finally after getting fed up with my poor concentration at work, I decided that meditation would help me with focus. I also wanted to fix my posture and the good posture you need while meditating seemed like a good way to improve how I sat. This was last summer, but it turned out that sitting was really hard physically. That’s mostly because I was sitting wrong. I gave up for a few months until January of last year rolled around when I decided to make meditating regularly one of my goals. At first I just tried to do it on a best effort basis, with the goal of 3 or 4 times a week. That ended poorly. It was much to easy to find an excuse to not meditate today because I was too tired or too busy.</p>
<p>Finally I decided to give <a href="">beeminder</a> a try. If you’ve never heard of beeminder you should <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/overview">go read this page post about it</a> but basically it’s a goal tracking with teeth. You can track my progress <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/tahnok/goals/meditate">here</a> (for those of you who are that bored). Having actual money on the line helped a lot. I started meditating considerably more often, but it wasn’t for very long periods, and I struggled a lot with the actual focus bit. My technique at this point was the same one I started out with initially. Counting 100 breaths while sitting cross-legged somewhere dark and quiet.</p>
<p>After getting frustrated and de-railling from my beeminder a few times, I went into RESEARCH MODE and scoured the internet. Someone from the <a href="http://lesswrong.com/">Less Wrong IRC</a> finally suggested the <a href="http://aromeditation.org/">Aro Meditation course</a>. It’s basically a weekly email that walks you through meditation as if you were a complete beginner. I highly recommend it as a resource if you are just starting out. One of the most useful pieces of information that it introduced was <a href="http://aromeditation.org/how-to-sit-like-a-human.html">how to site like a human</a>. Right now I am on week 13 of the Aro course and I can comfortably meditate for 30 minutes and I aim for 6 times a week. It’s been a pretty successful course I think, but I am starting to run into a wall.</p>
<p>Currently when I meditate I find it super difficult to quiet my mind and I often end up following trains of thought for quite some time before I realize I’ve let my mind wander. I suspect that this is because I tried to start using the more advanced meditations techniques suggested in the Aro course before I had masted the easy ones. I’m also going to try an experiment and use the meditation technique described <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/5jj/meditation_insight_and_rationality_part_2_of_3/">here</a></p>
<p>Has meditation increased my concentration? I’m not entirely sure. I think it’s helped since I am finding it easier to focus for long-ish periods of time at work, but there are so many other factors that have changed since my initial decision that I can’t in good faith assign a high probability to meditation being the cause of this.</p>
<p>Will I keep meditating? Yes, I think I will. My goals have shifted a bit towards trying to become more mindful. The most valuable part of regular meditation has been to spend some serious time examing my own mind and my own thoughts. It’s kind of amazing how easy it is to avoid noticing how your brain actually works.</p>

<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>Every now and then my paranoia will take over and I’ll have an urge to break free of all 3rd parties that I depend on for my life on the internet. The last time it struck I decided to set up my own mail server. I’m going to walk you through what I did in order to get it working</p>
<h2>Important Acronym List (IAL)</h2>
<p><strong>Mail Transfer Agent: MTA</strong> This is the piece of software that handles incoming AND outgoing email. It receives email and then decides whether or not the message is for one of the users it knows about. It also decides who gets to send email and handles the delivery. In this tutorial we’re going to be using <em>Postfix</em>. The primary protocol that it speaks is SMTP</p>
<p><strong>Internet Message Access Protocol: IMAP</strong> By default, postfix will deliver email messages to a folder on the computer it’s running on and the only way to access the messages is when you are logged into that box. Since this is kind of impractical, there are a ton of protocols that have been created to make accessing email messages on a remote server easy. We’re going to use <em>dovecot</em> and IMAP (the protocol) to access our messages on the server. You can also get dovecot to work with POP3, but this guide doesn’t cover getting it set up since it’s an older and less useful protocol.</p>
<h2>What you need</h2>
<ul>
<li>A domain</li>
<li>I use <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">namecheap</a>, but I hear good things about hover.com</li>
<li>A server</li>
<li>Preferably running debian or ubuntu. It will be helpful for preventing your mail from being marked as spam if you can set the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_DNS_lookup">PTR / reverse DNS</a> for this server’s IP address. Sadly, this means that you probably can’t run this on a server you have in your house. If you need a server, I recommend <a href="http://buyvm.net/">BuyVM</a> since they have a $15 a year VPS that is perfectly adequate for this purpose.</li>
<li>An SSL certificate</li>
<li>You can get one for free from <a href="https://www.startssl.com/">StartSSL</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<p>We’re mostly going to follow along with <a href="https://library.linode.com/email/postfix/postfix2.9.6-dovecot2.0.19-mysql">this guide from linode</a> except for the bits about MySQL [1]. I don’t understand why they would use MySQL here since it’s huge overkill unless you are dealing with a very large number of users. Instead of MySQL we’re going to use sqlite since it doesn’t require any processes to be running and eating up  the limited RAM available on the VPS.</p>
<p>You should follow the linode guide, except when they start talking about MySQL in which case you should come back here and see how to do it with SQLite. I’ve tried to match up the section/numbering so that it’s easy to figure out what to do differently.</p>
<h3>Installing Packages</h3>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Install these packages instead: <code>sudo apt-get install postfix postfix-mysql dovecot-core dovecot-imapd dovecot-lmtpd dovecot-sqlite sqlite</code></p>
<h4>Step 4 and 5</h4>
<p>Ignore</p>
<h3>SQLite instead of MySQL</h3>
<h4>Creating the database</h4>
<p>Download <a href="https://tahnok.me/cdn/mailbox.sqlite">this empty mailbox.sqlite</a> and put it in /etc/mailbox.sqlite or if you don’t trust me you can create you’re own with this schema:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/tahnok/9718301.js"></script></p>
<p>This will create our tables</p>
<h4>Adding data</h4>
<p>You can add data to sqlite database with the same syntax as MySQL, but interact with the database using the <code>sqlite</code> or <code>sqlite3</code> command instead of mysql</p>
<h3>Postfix</h3>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Use the following instead of the one in the guide</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/tahnok/9718346.js"></script></p>
<p>We’ll be using these file names later as well</p>
<h4>Step 11</h4>
<p>Use this instead: nano /etc/postfix/sqlite-virtual-mailbox-domains.cf</p>
<h4>Step 12</h4>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/tahnok/9718380.js"></script></p>
<h4>Step 15</h4>
<p>You can test the set up by referencing your sqlite file instead of the mysql one. eg: postmap -q example.com sqlite:/etc/postfix/sqlite-virtual-mailbox-domains.cf</p>
<h4>Step 16</h4>
<p>Use this instead: nano /etc/postfix/sqlite-virtual-mailbox-maps.cf</p>
<h4>Step 17</h4>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/tahnok/9718421.js"></script></p>
<h4>Step 20</h4>
<p>Test with: postmap -q email1@example.com sqlite:/etc/postfix/sqlite-virtual-mailbox-maps.cf</p>
<h4>Step 21</h4>
<p>Use this instead: nano /etc/postfix/sqlite-virtual-alias-maps.cf</p>
<h4>Step 22</h4>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/9718440.js"></script></p>
<h4>Step 25</h4>
<p>Test with: postmap -q alias@example.com sqlite:/etc/postfix/sqlite-virtual-alias-maps.cf (You get the idea at this point I hope)</p>
<h4>Step 28</h4>
<p>I skipped this bit entirely without any ill effects</p>
<h3>Dovecot</h3>
<h4>Step 25 to Step 28</h4>
<p>Please use the following as the contents of <em>dovecot-sql.conf.ext</em></p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/9718496.js"></script></p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>If all went well then you should be able to connect successfully to your new email server with your email client to both receive and send email! It’s amazing, I know.</p>
<p>In the next installment I’ll walk through the process of signing your email with DKIM so that it won’t get marked as spam by pretty much every email provider in existence</p>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p>I hate to admit it, but this is the second, or possibly third time that I’ve forgotten the password for my raspberry pi… I know that there are ways to <a href="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/4409/how-do-i-change-recover-my-password">reset</a> <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3//viewtopic.php?f=47&amp;t=20397">my</a> <a href="http://rpi.tnet.com/project/faqs/resetpasswd">password</a>, but most of them assume that the pi in question is attached to a monitor, and my pi is <strong>several</strong> feet from the nearest monitor. So, without further ado here is how to reset the password on your raspberry pi.</p>
<p><img src="../images/w600_9479331e0638efd4742504d30fc3463c.jpg" alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Raspberry_Pi_Beta_Board.jpg" style="height: auto;"></p>
<h1>Requirements</h1>
<ul>
<li>SD Card reader</li>
<li>Computer capable of mounting an EXT4 partition</li>
</ul>
<h1>Instructions</h1>
<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p>Unplug your pi and remove the SD card</p>
<h2>Step 2</h2>
<p>Insert the SD card into a working computer that you have root access on</p>
<h2>Step 3</h2>
<p><strong>As root</strong> edit the following file on your SD card:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/tahnok/9221769.js"></script></p>
<p>eg:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/tahnok/9221780.js"></script></p>
<p>It’s very important that you DON’T EDIT THIS FILE ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER. Things could get messy if you do that</p>
<h2>Step 4</h2>
<p>Locate the line that starts with <strong>pi</strong> and replace the text between the first and second : with the output of the following command:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/tahnok/9221808.js"></script></p>
<p>If you’re lazy you can use the following password hash: </p>
<p>$1$salty$SzJsU4qDcXp536Acnlp6I.</p>
<p>This will make the password for the pi user <strong>password</strong></p>
<h2>Step 5</h2>
<p>Eject the SD card and put it back in your pi and let it boot up.</p>
<h2>Step 6</h2>
<p>ssh into your pi and change the password to something else immediately. You can do this by running:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/tahnok/9221850.js"></script></p>
<p>and giving it the password you generated in step 4</p>
<h2>Step 7</h2>
<p>REMEMBER THE NEW PASSWORD YOU JUST CREATED</p>
<h1>WTF did you make me do?</h1>
<p>Well first of all, how do you think your computer knows your password? It would be silly to have it stored somewhere as it is, since that would make it pretty easy for someone to steal if they ever had access to your machine. Instead the computer stores it as a <strong>hash</strong>. That is, it takes the password and mangles it in a specific and repeatable way to produce password hash. The key part of the mangling process is that it’s one way. There’s no figuring out what the input is if your just have the output. When you give your computer the password at login it hashes it to see if it matches the one it has stored. On linux, these password hashes are stored in /etc/shadow. What we’ve done is change the stored password hash to something we new.</p>

      <p class="post-meta">Jan 29, 2014</p>
    </header>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p>Today I learned a lot about the way that Rails handles filters, that the methods: before_filter, around_filter and after_filter</p>
<p>I ran into a bug while working on the work to upgrade from rails 3.2 to 4.0 that I thought might be caused by a change in the way that filters are applied. Let’s see if you can guess what the following code would output.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Controller</strong><br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/tahnok/8701664.js"></script> </p>
<p>I initially thought that filters were sorted into different queues, then processed in the order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Around</li>
<li>Before</li>
<li>After</li>
</ol>
<p>Asking around, some people thought that the ordering was:</p>
<ol>
<li>Before </li>
<li>Around</li>
<li>After </li>
</ol>
<p>(although that may have been because of the way I framed the question)</p>
<p>It turns out both are wrong.</p>
<p>The output of that controller would be this:<br>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/tahnok/8701702.js"></script></p>
<p><strong>Filters are processed in the order they are defined.</strong></p>
<p>You can see that this is the intended behaviour in this test for rails: filters_test.rb</p>
<p>That makes a lot of sense after some thought. You’d want to be able to have some before_filters run before around_filters, but before_filters to run inside of around_filters.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Filters are processed in the order they are defined</p>

      <p class="post-meta">Nov 6, 2013</p>
    </header>

    <article class="post-content">
      <p><strong>edit</strong>: So it turns out that I found a bug in electric imp’s software. I shouldn’t have been able to register this particular imp to my own account. I will be posting an update soon on how to replace the ID chip that is included.</p>
<p>Shopify (where I work) happens to host the store that sells the Budweiser red light. In case you are not a hockey nut, the red light is that icon flashing red light they use to mark a goal. Budweiser sells these devices you can put up that will flash whenever a team scores a goal.</p>
<p><a href="http://postachio-images.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/f72f124e988b45f2872e5594525091e5/936d92e927d0845b605602dada1bd94a/w600_fca884a2a78f6e87d0b8d69456e0b9be.jpg"><img src="../images/w600_fca884a2a78f6e87d0b8d69456e0b9be.jpg"></a></p>
<p>So it turns out that hacking the budweiser red light is remarkably simple. I don’t know if this trick works if you’ve already configured your light, because I tried hacking this one before setting up the way that budweiser recommends</p>
<p>At the heart of the red light is this little device called an electric imp. It looks like an SD card, but actually it’s a microcontroller + wifi chip. To program the electric imp you have to “blink up" which involves installing an app on your phone and using it to setup wifi and register it to your electric imp dev account.</p>
<p><a href="http://postachio-images.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/f72f124e988b45f2872e5594525091e5/936d92e927d0845b605602dada1bd94a/w600_bb7ce4c568ac7765927d1f0cdac8fcee.png"><img src="../images/w600_bb7ce4c568ac7765927d1f0cdac8fcee.png"></a></p>
<p>I’m still exploring how the light works, but I got lucky and tried to toggle pin 9, which turns out is exactly the right pin to toggle! I can’t keep the light on, or turn the buzzer on myself, but setting the pin high for 2 seconds, then setting it low again causes the light to turn on and spin for a couple of seconds and buzz (unless you turned down the volume, which I did)</p>
<p>The electric imp consists of two pieces an “Agent" which lives in the cloud and can respond to http requests and a “device" which is the actual hardware that connects to the real world.</p>
<p>Here’s my code for the agent:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/tahnok/7343067.js"></script> </p>
<p>And here’s my code for the device</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/tahnok/7343047.js"></script></p>
<p>I’m probably going to write a script to poke the url whenever something interesting happens, although I’m not sure what yet. I’m also not sure how sleeping on the device works… Will it keep polling forever? Do I have to wake it up?</p>
<p>Happy hacking! </p>
