FACT: There are SO MANY COOL THINGS TO LEARN/EXPLORE.
It's easy to spend a bit of time everyday looking at something different.

I'm trying out an experiment where I try and focus all my free time on learning one thing at a time.
This week's focus is going to be on Ham radio.

It's been a while I've had to study something that I can't immediately practice.
Learning to code or knit are easy since you get immediate feedback.

Instead, I need to fallback to my university study habits.
I'm going to be making use [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/949548458) to make a deck of study cards.

I've also got a copy of the new Study guide on the way.

Also, the university of waterloo amateur radio club has a good study guide http://uwarc.uwaterloo.ca/guide/
